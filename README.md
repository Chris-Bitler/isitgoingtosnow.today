## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to make something that I could use to experiment with the weather underground APIs
but that followed in a similar vein to this 'isitxyz.com' websites.

## Installation
The easiest way to install this is just to copy the files over to a webserver that can run php (such as apache) and then update weather/settings.php with the key you got from weatherunderground.
